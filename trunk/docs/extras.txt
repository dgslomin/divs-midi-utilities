The programs in the src/extras directory aren't built by default, as they're
either obsolete or incomplete.  They're included in the package primarily so
that I don't lose track of them, but there's useful code to borrow in there,
and I may return to working on some of them if there's enough demand.

Noteable inclusions:  Piano Protagonist, a MIDI take on the game Guitar Hero;
melodygrep, a heuristic-based utility for identifying unlabeled MIDI files
which contain a specified melody; and several attempts to build a full
linear or step-based sequencer using different GUI toolkits.  This last is
something of a quixotic quest for me which has been going on for many years,
and most of my standalone utilities are actually spin-offs from that project.
