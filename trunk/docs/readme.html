<h1>Div's MIDI Utilities</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Here is a collection of MIDI utilities I wrote for myself, which you may find useful as well.  I previously kept separate collections of MIDI utilities for Windows and for Unix, but due to an increasing amount of overlap, I have combined them into a single package.</p>

<p>Regardless of platform, the utilities are all written according to the Unix design philosophy; most run from the command line instead of providing a GUI, and each is small and dedicated to a specific task.  Some work in realtime, while others act upon	saved MIDI files.</p>

<p>The Windows utilities should work on any recent version of Windows.  They come with ready-to-run binaries in addition to a Microsoft-compatible build harness.</p>

<p>Most of the Unix utilities work on raw MIDI streams, so they should be compatible with just about everything, including ALSA, OpenSound, and MacOS/X.  They communicate via the standard Unix file interface, so they can read and write directly to a device, to anonymous pipes, or to named FIFOs.  The standard tee(1) and mkfifo(1) utilities will come in very useful when working with them.</p>

<p>Only a few of the Unix utilities have dependencies beyond the standard C library, and they are built conditionally.  A few are ALSA-specific, and thus require the ALSA library and headers to be installed.  Another interacts with X Windows (although it has no visible GUI), so it requires Xlib to be installed.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<p>2008-09-13 - Added <em>alsamidi2pipe</em>, <em>pipe2alsamidi</em>, <em>alsamidi2net</em>, and <em>net2alsamidi</em>.  Added more options to <em>playsmf</em>.</p>

<p>2008-06-11 - Updated the <em>midifile</em> library to support several common musical and SMPTE time formats, with intelligent handling of meters and tempos.  Added utilities to help with seamless gluing of multiple takes: <em>average-tempo</em>, <em>average-velocity</em>, <em>scale-tempo</em>, <em>scale-velocity</em>, <em>offset-tempo</em>, and <em>offset-velocity</em>.  Added another map for <em>qwertymidi</em>.  Also tidied up the source tree and build harnesses.  Wow, ten years since I released the first version of this package!</p>

<p>2007-10-29 - Added a few convenience options to the ALSA version of <em>brainstorm</em>.  Also added <em>alsamidipipe</em> to make it easier to use the traditional pipe-based Unix utilities in combination with ALSA, even if you don't have a /dev/midi* device set up for each port you care about.  On the Windows side, replaced <em>mciplaysmf</em> with <em>playsmf</em>, which uses the <em>midifile</em> library instead of the MCI sequencer.</p>

<p>2006-06-28 - Combined the Unix and Windows packages into one (the Unix utilities are now under the same licence as the Windows ones).  Updated the Unix utilities to handle <em>active sensing</em> properly.  Added a fully modern, ALSA-specific version of <em>brainstorm</em>.  Also added a preview version of <em>imp</em>, a fancy successor to <em>qwertymidi</em> which understands multiple USB keyboards plugged in at the same time.</p>

<p>2005-03-24 - Added a significant amount of functionality to the <em>midifile</em> library, making it suitable for building a much broader range of software.  Added <em>tempo-map</em>, <em>joycc</em>, and the <em>mish</em> compiler.  Added new maps for <em>qwertymidi</em>.  Also changed the package's license from LGPL to BSD, since it is even more generous to users.</p>

<p>2004-10-09 - Added a simple sampler (<em>beatbox</em>) and MIDI file player (<em>mciplaysmf</em>).  The sampler introduces new dependencies on the free <em>sndfile</em> and <em>portaudio</em> libraries, but the necessary parts are included in the kit.  The player is here by popular user request, although I cheated and used the MCI sequencer which is part of Windows rather than implementing my own from scratch.  Also rewrote <em>brainstorm</em> to use the <em>midifile</em> library for robustness, and gave it some new features as well.</p>

<p>2003-06-27 - By user request, the <em>midifile</em> library now provides control over the MIDI file format (0, 1, or 2).</p>

<p>2003-04-27 - Added <em>pulsar</em>, <em>padpedal</em>, and <em>sendmidi</em>.  No more external dependencies to build; the necessary parts of <em>expat</em> are now included in the kit.</p>

<p>2003-03-11 - Added <em>fakesustain</em> and <em>multiecho</em>.</p>

<p>2003-02-22 - Introducing <em>metercaster</em>, a new way to adjust the timing of MIDI sequences without the dehumanizing side effects of quantization.  When I went to implement it, I was surprised to find that there was no readily available, free C library for reading and writing standard MIDI files, so I'm also introducing the <em>midifile</em> library, which fills the niche.</p>

<p>2003-01-23 - <em>Brainstorm</em> now outputs more conventional MIDI files (format 1 with PPQ timing, rather than format 0 with SMPTE timing), so they will be compatible with more software.</p>

<p>2003-01-20 - Fixed a critical bug in <em>brainstorm</em>.  Also made significant improvements to the build system and packaging.</p>

<h2>The Utilities</h2>

<h3>alsamidi2net (Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility acts as a bridge between the pipe-based utilities and NetMIDI; it is a NetMIDI client.</p>

<p>Usage: alsamidi2net --server &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;port&gt; [ --name &lt;client name&gt; ] [ --connect &lt;client name or number to which to connect&gt; &lt;port number&gt; ]</p>

<h3>alsamidi2pipe (Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility acts as a bridge between ALSA and the pipe-based utilities.</p>

<p>Usage: alsamidi2pipe [ --fifo &lt;fifo&gt;  ] [ --name &lt;client name&gt; ] [ --connect &lt;client name or number to which to connect&gt; &lt;port number&gt; ]</p>

<h3>average-tempo (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is useful in conjunction with <em>scale-tempo</em> and <em>offset-tempo</em> for patching up multiple takes of a song to match one another.  It tells you the average tempo over the specified section of a song.  This is particularly useful if the tempo varies frequently, as is the case when the song has been through <em>tempo-map</em> or <em>metercaster</em>.</p>

<p>Usage: average-tempo [ --tick | --beat | --mb | --mbt | --time | --hms | --hmsf ] [ --from &lt;time&gt; ] [ --to &lt;time&gt; ] &lt;filename.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>average-velocity (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>Similarly, this command line utility is useful in conjunction with <em>scale-velocity</em> and <em>offset-velocity</em>.  It tells you the average note velocity over the specified section of a song.</p>

<p>Usage: average-velocity [ --tick | --beat | --mb | --mbt | --time | --hms | --hmsf ] [ --from &lt;time&gt; ] [ --to &lt;time&gt; ] [ --track &lt;n&gt; ] &lt;filename.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>beatbox (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is a very simple, percussion-oriented sampler.  It plays prerecorded audio files (WAV, AIFF, or AU) in response to MIDI note events.  I do plan to make a pattern sequencer which, combined with this, will be equivalent to a drum machine, but for now you'll have to generate the events on your own.</p>

<p>Usage: beatbox [ --in &lt;n&gt; ] [ --voices &lt;n&gt; ] ( [ --config &lt;filename&gt; ] ) ...</p>

<h3>brainstorm (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility functions as a dictation machine for MIDI.  It listens for incoming MIDI events and saves them to a new MIDI file every time you pause in your playing for a few seconds.  The filenames are generated automatically based on the current time, so it requires no interaction.  I find it useful for recording brainstorming sessions, hence the name.</p>

<p>Usage (Windows version): brainstorm [ --in &lt;device id&gt; ] [ --timeout &lt;seconds&gt; ] [ --extra-time &lt;seconds&gt; ] [ --prefix &lt;filename prefix&gt; ] [ --verbose ]</p>

<p>Usage (original Unix version): brainstorm &lt;input fifo&gt; &lt;filename prefix&gt; &lt;timeout in seconds&gt;</p>

<p>Usage (ALSA-specific version): abrainstorm [ --prefix &lt;filename prefix&gt; ] [ --timeout &lt;seconds&gt; ] [ --confirmation &lt;command line&gt; ] [ --connect &lt;client name or number&gt; &lt;port number&gt; ]</p>

<p>Note that by default, the ALSA version does not connect up to an existing MIDI output port; rather it creates a new MIDI input port which you can then connect up as you see fit.  <em>aconnect</em>, <em>aconnectgui</em>, and <em>qjackctl</em> are common utilities which can be used to do this.</p>

<p>The confirmation option allows you to specify a command to execute whenever a file is saved, so that you know your music is safe.  I use it to play a short audio file, in keeping with brainstorm's "interfaceless" design, but you can get fairly elaborate if you want.  The filename will be substituted for each <code>%s</code> in the command.</p>

<h3>delta (Windows)</h3>

<p>This is a fun to play, monophonic variation on <em>qwertymidi</em> which maps keys on the computer keyboard to relative intervals instead of absolute pitches.  It was inspired by an <a href="http://www.samchillian.com/">unusual MIDI controller</a> I read about online.  It also supports custom keyboard mappings.</p>

<p>Usage: delta [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --channel &lt;n&gt; ] [ --program &lt;n&gt; ] [ --velocity &lt;n&gt; ] [ --map &lt;str&gt; ]</p>

<h3>dispmidi (Unix)</h3>

<p>Like <em>midimon</em> for Windows, this utility pretty-prints incoming MIDI messages.  Why two different names?  The answer is lost to history.</p>

<p>Usage: dispmidi &lt;input fifo&gt;</p>

<h3>fakesustain (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility pre-applies sustain to note events.  It is useful for software-based synthesizers which have incomplete MIDI implementations that don't respond to real sustain messages.  (VST is a good idea, but can be frustrating in practice.)</p> 

<p>Usage: fakesustain [ --in &lt;n&gt; ] [ --out &lt;n&gt; ]</p>

<h3>imp (Windows)</h3>

<p>This true GUI program requires Windows XP or newer because it uses Microsoft's new "rawinput" API.  This allows it to distinguish amongst multiple USB keyboards plugged into the same computer at the same time.  You can use it to achieve the same effect as <em>qwertymidi</em>, but with larger and more complex mappings.  Beware that this is currently a preview release, and its interface and file format will most likely change.</p>

<p>Usage: imp [ &lt;filename&gt; ]</p>

<h3>intervals (Unix)</h3>

<p>This filter-style utility plays parallel intervals for incoming MIDI messages.</p>

<p>Usage: intervals &lt;input_fifo&gt; &lt;output_fifo&gt; &lt;interval 1&gt; &lt;interval 2&gt; ...</p>

<h3>joycc (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is functionally similar to <em>joypedal</em>, but is designed to work with real joysticks.  Up to three directional axes and four buttons on each of two joysticks can be mapped to separate MIDI controllers.</p>

<p>Usage: joycc [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --channel &lt;n&gt; ] [ --x1 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --y1 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --z1 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --a1 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --b1 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --c1 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --d1 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --x2 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --y2 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --z2 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --a2 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --b2 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --c2 &lt;n&gt; ] [ --d2 &lt;n&gt; ]</p>

<h3>joypedal (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line/text mode interactive utility requires custom hardware.  It looks for an organ style volume/expression pedal attached to the computer's joystick port, and translates its value into MIDI controller messages.  I wrote this because my synthesizer hardwires its expression pedal to control volume, rather than making it assignable through MIDI.  Extremely simple instructions for building the joystick port adapter (for around 5 USD in parts) are included, but ATTEMPT THIS OR ANY OTHER CUSTOM HARDWARE PROJECT AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

<p>Usage: joypedal [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --channel &lt;n&gt; ] [ --controller &lt;n&gt; ] [ --graph ]</p>

<h3>jumpoctave (Unix)</h3>

<p>This filter-style utility lets you use the pitch bend wheel as an octave jump control.</p>

<p>Usage: jumpoctave &lt;input fifo&gt; &lt;output fifo&gt;</p>

<h3>lsmidiins (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility displays a numbered list of the Windows MIDI input ports.  Most of the other Windows utilities here refer to ports by number.</p>

<p>Usage: lsmidiins</p>

<h3>lsmidiouts (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility displays a numbered list of the Windows MIDI output ports.</p>

<p>Usage: lsmidiouts</p>

<h3>metercaster (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility implements a brand new, unique algorithm for adjusting the timing of a MIDI sequence.  Unlike conventional quantization, meter casting does not replace the human characteristics of your playing with a mechanistic feel.  Instead, you place waypoints in the sequence to tell <em>metercaster</em> what the proper time should be for events of your choosing, and it interpolates among them, coming up with the proper times for the rest of the events.  This version is meant to be used iteratively, as you specify a single waypoint per invocation.  <em>Metercaster</em> is especially useful in conjunction with <em>brainstorm</em>, whose interfaceless design makes a metronome inappropriate.</p>

<p>Usage: metercaster [ --left ( marker &lt;name&gt; | cc &lt;number&gt; &lt;value&gt; ) ] [ --old-right ( marker &lt;name&gt; | cc &lt;number&gt; &lt;value&gt; ) ] [ --new-right ( marker &lt;name&gt; | cc &lt;number&gt; &lt;value&gt; ) ] [ --verbose ] &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<h3>midimon (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility pretty-prints incoming MIDI messages from any number of Windows MIDI input ports.  It can be useful for debugging complex MIDI setups, but there's nothing special about it.</p>

<p>Usage: midimon [ --in &lt;n&gt; ] ...</p>

<h3>midithru (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility reads from any number of Windows MIDI input ports, merges the streams together, and copies the result to any number of Windows MIDI output ports.  You can think of it as a combination of a hardware thru box and merge box.</p>

<p>Usage: midithru [ --in &lt;input device id&gt; ... ] [ --out &lt;output device id&gt; ... ]</p>

<h3>mish (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is a compiler for a text-based music notation language which I invented, called "Mish" (<u>MI</u>DI <u>sh</u>orthand).  It converts Mish files into standard MIDI files.</p>

<p>Usage: mish --in &lt;input.mish&gt; --out &lt;output.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>multiecho (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility can add multiple echoes to your performance, with configurable delay, pitch offset, and velocity scaling.</p>

<p>Usage: multiecho [ --in &lt;n&gt; ] [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --echo &lt;delay in ms&gt; &lt;note interval&gt; &lt;velocity percent&gt; ... ]</p>

<h3>net2alsamidi (Unix)</h3>

<p>This utility provides the inverse of alsamidi2net; it is a NetMIDI server.</p>

<p>Usage: net2alsamidi --port &lt;port&gt; [ --name &lt;client name&gt; ] [ --connect &lt;client name or number to which to connect&gt; &lt;port number&gt; ]</p>

<h3>netmidic (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is a client for the NetMIDI protocol.  It forwards messages from a Windows MIDI input port to a NetMIDI server.  NetMIDI can be used to connect up the MIDI systems on two different machines over TCP/IP, even if they are running different operating systems.</p>

<p>Usage: netmidic [ --in &lt;n&gt; ] [ --hostname &lt;name&gt; ] [ --port &lt;n&gt; ]</p>

<h3>netmidid (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is a daemon (server) for the NetMIDI protocol.  It forwards messages from NetMIDI clients to a Windows MIDI output port.</p>

<p>Usage: netmidid [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --port &lt;n&gt; ]</p>

<h3>net2pipe (Unix)</h3>

<p>Most of the other Unix utilities here communicate over FIFOs, but this utility can be used to bridge them to NetMIDI.  Actually, this utility will copy any data from a TCP connection to a FIFO, so it is not MIDI specific; it is similar to netcat (which I didn't know about at the time I wrote this).</p>

<p>Usage: net2pipe &lt;port&gt; [ &lt;output fifo&lt; ]</p>

<h3>normalizesmf (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is a minimal demonstration of the <em>midifile</em> library.  It reads in a MIDI file, then writes it out again.  If your sequencer complains that a file is invalid, this normalizer might make it more palatable.</p>

<p>Usage: normalizesmf &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<h3>notemap (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility lets you remap the layout of notes on your MIDI keyboard.  I originally wrote it to see whether the guitar concept of "alternate tunings" could be applied to the piano.  That experiment was a failure, but notemap has since become essential to me for playing drums from the piano keyboard.</p>

<p>Usage: notemap &lt;filename&gt;.xml</p>

<h3>offset-tempo (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility adds a constant amount to each tempo event in the specified section of a song.</p>

<p>Usage: offset-tempo [ --tick | --beat | --mb | --mbt | --time | --hms | --hmsf ] [ --from &lt;time&gt; ] [ --to &lt;time&gt; ] --amount &lt;n&gt; [ --out &lt;filename.mid&gt; ] &lt;filename.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>offset-velocity (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>Similarly, this command line utility adds a constant amount to the velocity of each note in the specified section of a song.</p>

<p>Usage: offset-velocity [ --tick | --beat | --mb | --mbt | --time | --hms | --hmsf ] [ --from &lt;time&gt; ] [ --to &lt;time&gt; ] [ --track &lt;n&gt; ] --amount &lt;n&gt; [ --out &lt;filename.mid&gt; ] &lt;filename.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>onpedal (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility runs a program or script every time you press the sustain pedal.  If you hold down the pedal for more time, it runs a second program.  I use it for turning pages in scanned copies of sheet music displayed on screen (I have more than one pedal, so I don't have to give up sustain).</p>

<p>Usage: onpedal --in &lt;n&gt; --command &lt;str&gt; [ --hold-length &lt;n&gt; ] [ --hold-command &lt;str&gt; ]</p>

<h3>padpedal (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is a variation on the idea of a sustenuto pedal (the middle pedal on most grand pianos) which adds a "pad" accompaniment to your playing.</p>

<p>Usage: padpedal [ --in &lt;port&gt; &lt;channel&gt; ] [ --pad-in &lt;port&gt; &lt;channel&gt; &lt;controller&gt; ] [ --out &lt;port&gt; &lt;channel&gt; ] [ --pad-out &lt;port&gt; &lt;channel&gt; ]</p>

<h3>pedalnote (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility plays a note whenever you press the sustain pedal.  I use it for kick drums.</p>

<p>Usage: pedalnote [ --in &lt;n&gt; ] [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --channel &lt;n&gt; ] [ --note &lt;n&gt; ] [ --velocity &lt;n&gt; ]</p>

<h3>pipe2alsamidi (Unix)</h3>

<p>This utility provides the inverse of alsamidi2pipe.</p>

<p>Usage: pipe2alsamidi [ --fifo &lt;fifo&gt;  ] [ --name &lt;client name&gt; ] [ --connect &lt;client name or number to which to connect&gt; &lt;port number&gt; ]</p>

<h3>pipe2net (Unix)</h3>

<p>As you could probably tell from its name, this utility provides the inverse of <em>net2pipe</em>.</p>

<p>Usage: pipe2net [ &lt;input fifo&lt; ] &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;port&gt;</p>

<h3>playsmf (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is a generic MIDI file player.  Nothing special, but it gets along well with the other utilities.  Now based on the <em>midifile</em> library, this replaces the older <em>mciplaysmf</em>.</p>

<p>Usage: playsmf [ --out &lt;device id&gt; ] [ -- ] &lt;filename.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>pulsar (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility pulses any depressed notes according to a configurable rhythm.</p>

<p>Usage: pulsar [ --in &lt;n&gt; ] [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --pulse &lt;time before pulse&gt; &lt;length of pulse&gt; &lt;time after pulse&gt; ] ...</p>

<h3>qwertymidi (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line/text mode interactive utility lets you use your computer keyboard as if it were a synthesizer keyboard.  It supports custom mapping of the keyboard layout by means of a config file.  A <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/HTML/_langref_key_scan_codes.asp">list of keyboard scan codes</a> will be useful for configuring the mapping.  Sample maps are included for the common piano-like tracker keyboard layout, the experimental von Janko piano keyboard layout from the 1850's, the Hayden accordian button layout, and a General MIDI drum kit.</p>

<p>Usage: qwertymidi [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --channel &lt;n&gt; ] [ --program &lt;n&gt; ] [ --velocity &lt;n&gt; ] [ --map &lt;str&gt; ]</p>

<h3>rw (Unix)</h3>

<p>On some operating systems, devices such as <code>/dev/midi</code> can only be opened by a single program at a time, which is a problem if you want different programs to read and write to it simultaneously.  This utility, while not necessarily MIDI specific, can be used to split out a device's input and output to separate FIFOs.</p>

<p>Usage: rw &lt;device file&gt; &lt;input fifo&gt; &lt;output fifo&gt;</p>

<h3>scale-tempo (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility multiples each tempo event in the specified section of a song by a constant amount.</p>

<p>Usage: scale-tempo [ --tick | --beat | --mb | --mbt | --time | --hms | --hmsf ] [ --from &lt;time&gt; ] [ --to &lt;time&gt; ] --amount &lt;n&gt; [ --out &lt;filename.mid&gt; ] &lt;filename.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>scale-velocity (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>Similarly, this command line utility multiples the velocity of each note in the specified section of a song by a constant amount.</p>

<p>Usage: scale-velocity [ --tick | --beat | --mb | --mbt | --time | --hms | --hmsf ] [ --from &lt;time&gt; ] [ --to &lt;time&gt; ] [ --track &lt;n&gt; ] --amount &lt;n&gt; [ --out &lt;filename.mid&gt; ] &lt;filename.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>sendmidi (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility sends a single specified MIDI message.  It can be used for scripting, or as a poor man's knob box.</p>

<p>Usage: sendmidi [ --out &lt;port&gt; ] ( --note-off &lt;channel&gt; &lt;pitch&gt; &lt;velocity&gt; | --note-on &lt;channel> &lt;pitch&gt; &lt;velocity&gt; | --key-pressure &lt;channel&gt; &lt;pitch&gt; &lt;amount&gt; | --control-change &lt;channel&gt; &lt;number&gt; &lt;value&gt; | --program-change &lt;channel&gt; &lt;number&gt; | --channel-pressure &lt;channel&gt; &lt;amount&gt; | --pitch-wheel &lt;channel&gt; &lt;amount&gt; )</p>

<h3>smftoxml (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility is another demonstration of the <em>midifile</em> library.  It converts a MIDI file into an ad hoc XML equivalent.  This can be useful for seeing exactly what is in the file, and how it is arranged in the data structures of midifilelib.</p>

<p>Usage: smftoxml &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<h3>tempo-map (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility can be used to acheive a similar effect to <em>metercaster</em>, but is far faster and more intuitive to use.  Inspired by, but more powerful than the "fit to improvisation" feature in Cakewalk, it expects the following usage model:  First, you record your performance without a metronome, as with <em>brainstorm</em>.  Next, ignoring any beat markers your sequencer might display, you add a click track consisting of one note per beat, synchronized with your performance.  <em>Tempo-map</em> then processes the file, adjusting the timestamps of existing events and inserting new tempo events so that performance sounds the same when played back, but the notes will line up with beats when displayed in the sequencer.  You can then selectively delete the inserted tempo events, resulting in a steady but still completely nuanced recording.</p>

<p>Usage: tempo-map --click-track &lt;n&gt; [ --out &lt;filename.mid&gt; ] &lt;filename.mid&gt;</p>

<h3>transpose (Unix)</h3>

<p>This filter-style utility transposes incoming MIDI messages by a specified interval.</p>

<p>Usage: transpose &lt;input fifo&gt; &lt;output fifo&gt; &lt;interval&gt;</p>

<h3>velocityfader (Windows)</h3>

<p>This command line utility scales incoming note velocities according to the current value of a specified continuous controller.  This gives you a different sort of volume control than normal, in that it only affects new notes coming in, leaving the sustained ones alone.  It can also be used to add pedal-operated volume control to a synth that doesn't support standard expression messages.</p>

<p>Usage: velocityfader [ --in &lt;n&gt; ] [ --out &lt;n&gt; ] [ --controller &lt;n&gt; ] [ --inverted ]</p>

<h3>verbosify (Unix)</h3>

<p>This filter-style utility normalizes incoming MIDI messages to a canonical form, like a realtime equivalent to <em>normalizesmf</em>.  It should not change the way things sound, but may make it easier to postprocess the stream.</p>

<p>Usage: verbosify &lt;input fifo&gt; &lt;output fifo&gt;</p>

<h3>xmidiqwerty (Unix)</h3>

<p>This is an experimental, partially completed program which lets you use a MIDI keyboard as a chording text keyboard in X11.  It runs as a standard program sending synthetic keyboard events rather than an IME, so it does not require any complex installation nor disrupt the use of your normal keyboard.</p>

<p>Usage: xmidiqwerty (reads from standard input)</p>

<h3>xmltosmf (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This command line utility converts the ad hoc XML format emitted from <em>smftoxml</em> back into a valid MIDI file.  By combining the two of them, you can modify MIDI files with a text editor or even with XSLT.</p>

<p>Usage: xmltosmf &lt;filename&gt;.xml &lt;filename&gt;.mid</p>

<h2>Useful Libraries Also Provided</h2>

<h3>midifile (Windows, Unix)</h3>

<p>This powerful and practical library allows you to read and write Standard MIDI Files (SMF), and provides a data structure for MIDI sequences.  Essentially, it is the core of a MIDI sequencer without the user interface and the realtime recording and playback functionality.</p>

<h3>midimsg (Unix)</h3>

<p>This library provides an abstraction around raw realtime MIDI streams.  It hides annoying complexities like running status and active sensing.  Unnecessary for Windows or native ALSA programs, since this functionality is already provided for you there.</p>

<p>On Windows, a MIDI loopback utility is necessary to get the most out of these programs.  It will provide extra Windows MIDI ports which allow you to wire multiple MIDI programs together instead of speaking directly to your sound card or synthesizer.  While several such programs exist, both free and commercial, I have had good luck with the free <a href="http://www.midiox.com/">MIDI Yoke</a>.  Make sure you download the correct version, as there are separate ones for Windows 95/98/ME and NT/2000/XP.</p>

<p><a href="http://linux-sound.org/">Dave Phillips</a> maintains the central directory of sound and MIDI software for Linux.  If you're using that platform, anything else you might need is either there, or you'll have to write it yourself.  &#x263A;</p>
