
Current plans for the sequencer project ("Seqer"), as of 2013-02-13:

This generation of Seqer is centered around a single megawidget, which combines aspects of an event list and a piano roll.  The event list portion is traditional in its columns, but its rows are worth discussion.

There is one row for each event.  Rows are grouped into "steps" of a configurable time unit.  Events don't have to occur at the start of a step.  If no event occurs during a particular step, an empty row is displayed.  If more than one event occurs during a step, additional rows are displayed, stretching the vertical axis out of its normal, linear scale.

A vertical piano roll functions as an additional, graphical column in the table, with time mapped into a vertical position by interpolating between the vertical positions where successive steps start (ignoring individual rows).







What should the columns be?

cakewalk: track, hmsf time, mbt time, channel, type, note, velocity, duration
cubase: type, time, end time, duration, note, velocity, release velocity, channel, comment
logic: time, type, channel, note, velocity, duration
dp: time, note, velocity, release velocity, duration
reaper: index, time, duration, channel, type, note, velocity
seqer: type, time, track, channel, note, velocity, duration, release velocity







Step size and zoom:

   Amount: [6				  ]

	 Mode: (x) Steps per measure
		   ( ) Measures per step
		   ( ) Seconds per step

		   [Ok] [Cancel]


In "steps per measure" mode, zoom in and out moves through a series of zoom levels which consists of the factors of the numerator of the current time signature, followed by powers of two times that numerator (e.g., for 12/8 it would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96...).  The dialog lets the user type in a non-series number to achieve tuplets.  Zoom in or out from a tuplet goes to the next nearest series number.

Measures in other time signatures than the current are assigned the nearest zoom level in their respective series (determined by comparing duration in quarter notes, and rounding to the finer zoom level when ambiguous).  The other time signatures always get a series value even when the current time signature has been assigned a non-series tuplet.

In "measures per step" mode, zoom in and out moves through powers of two.

One measure per step is not exactly the same as one step per measure, since the latter is affected by time signature (e.g., setting the zoom to one step per measure when the current measure is in 3/8 results in two steps per measure for other sections of the song in 6/8).  Zooming out from one step per measure results in two measures per step.  Zooming in from one measure per step results in the second value in the current measure's "steps per measure" series.  This allows the user to get to both one measure per step and one step per measure solely by zooming in and out, by overshooting and coming back.

In "seconds per step" mode, zoom in and out moves through factors of two just like "measures per step" mode.  However, fractional (positive floating point) amounts are supported, so there is no need for a separate "steps per second" mode (and no complex logic for transitioning between them).






TODO:
	event grid
		insert/delete/edit operations
		mouse support for navigate/select
	piano roll
		mouse support for select
	selection/clipboard infrastructure
	multi-window infrastructure
	realtime MIDI infrastructure
		mapping from port name strings (arbitrarily user-selectable) to actual output ports
		no arming of tracks; record should always target the current track
		MIDI sync master
		MIDI sync slave (much harder)
	macros
		Current plan (of many possible approaches):
		Macros would be based solely around record and playback of other commands.
		There would be 36 available macro slots, one for each letter and number.
		A vi-like record command which would take the slot identifier as an argument (no popup dialog when the record command is invoked from a keyboard shortcut).  Invoking the record command again would finish the recording.
		Pressing alt+shift+(slot) would invoke the macro.  Since this type of keyboard binding supports hold-down-to-repeat, there's no need for a vi-like "." command or user-controllable mapping of arbitrary keystrokes.
		Open question: should macros persist in the application's saved state?
	external tool infrastructure
		There should be a command for running the current sequence through an external program whose command line can be specified in a popup (with substitution parameters for input/output temp filenames).  An option would control whether this is uni- or bidirectional.  If bidirectional, the sequence would be replaced by the output of the tool, but Seqer would attempt to apply the same view settings and cursor location as had been in effect before the tool was invoked.
		This would be a quick way to get tempo mapping, etc. into Seqer, as well as supporting user scripting.  Would be particularly nice in combination with macros.
	non-realtime MIDI input
		step-time recording = add at current grid step and don't automatically move on to the next step
		also support MMC for remote control of the transport
