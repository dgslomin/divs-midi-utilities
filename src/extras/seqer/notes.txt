Current plans for the sequencer project ("Seqer") as of 2021-07-01:

This generation of Seqer is based around a linear piano roll window with note,
numeric value, and label lanes; a sidebar for details; and a cursor for equal
prioritization of mouse and keyboard interaction.  It's built using Qt and
RtMidi.

TODO:
inspector
keyboard navigation and tweaking
tracks and channels side panels
lane groups
external utils
playback
recording
preferences including ports, colors, and keyboard shortcuts

save lane state
middle drag scroll/zoom
bounds checking when setting midi event properties
adjust zoom_y/scroll_y so that max possible value is never less than lane height
